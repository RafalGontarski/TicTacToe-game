# Tic Tac Toe - Strategy Game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic, simple strategy game where two players take turns placing their marks on a 3x3 board: a cross (X) and a circle (O). The object of the game is to place three of your own characters in a line - vertically, horizontally or diagonally - before your opponent does.
